## About
![Printer Internals Image](./docs/images/XYZRender.JPG)

This repo contains the code for a 2021 Senior Design Project at Iowa State University. 

This project is the continuation of the work of two previous Senior Design teams.

The original objective was to create a 3D Printer system that uses metal powder to create small cubes, however resource constraints lead to a reduction in project scope. As of 2021, we have completed a rewrite of the original C# printer control application in Matlab for better maintainability by CNDE researchers, and for future students that will pick up the project.
