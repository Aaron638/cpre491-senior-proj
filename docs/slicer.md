# Slicer Program Documentation

## Overview:
An infill is a series of interior walls for maintaining the structure of the object while it gets printed layer by layer.

A Slicer program usually translates a 3D model into G-Code instructions, but because our 3D printer has some unique criteria and constraints, we must write our own.

Previous senior design groups provided us with various `.gcode` files to work with, but they all use diagonal scanlines, while Dr. Bigelow has asked us to do rasterization:

This website: https://nraynaud.github.io/webgcode/ lets us visualize where the motors are moving the laser step by step.

`GCodeParser.cs` shows us that they used 3 custom defined `M` codes:
```c
// Custom defined M codes for our 3D printer: 
// M200: Execute layer change
// M201: Laser on
// M202: Laser off
```
The primary gcode type they use is the `G1` code, which tells the motors to move the laser at a constant velocity to the coordinates. 

For example, this `.gcode` starts the laser at (0,0), turns it on, draws a line to (0,1), then turns it off.

```gcode
    G1 X0.0000 Y0.0000
    M201
    G1 X0.0000 Y1.0000
    M202
```
# Slicer Files Documentation

## Location
All slicer files live in the directory stl_to_gcode/Slicer

## config.json
This JSON file is used to pass cube parameters to the slicer_ctrl.m file. Parameters in this file are listed bellow. 
**filename**: specifies filename path for the gcode file
**length**: total length of the cube in cm
**width**: total width of the cube in cm
**height**: total height of the cueb in cm
**layer_height**: the height of each layer in the cube in com
**voxels_per_length**: amount of voxels in each layer by length
**voxels_per_width**: amount of voxels in each layer by width
**voxel_margin**: the margin between voxels in cm
**voxel_padding**: the padding beteen voxels in cm
**defects**: 2D array of defects where each defect is an array coordinate points that describe where each defect is in the cube, if any of the arrays have -1 as a value in the array, that defect array is ignored
**defect_x_origin**: the origin x coordinate point of the defect
**defect_y_origin**: the origin y coordinate point of the defect
**defect_z_origin**: the origin z coordinate point of the defect
**defect_width**: the defect's total width
**defect_length**: the defect's total length
**defect_height**: the defect's total height 

## defect.gcode
A gcode file that is generated if defects are being generated. Is the result of defects being inserted into a gcode file.

## gen_cube.m
Main function that generates the gcode file. Creates the overall cube and calls other functions to insert the voxels.
Does not insert defects (that happens after this function if needed). 

## gen_voxel.m
Helper function to the gen_cube.m file that inserts 0 degree rasterization pattern voxels into the cube.

## gen_voxels_90_degrees.m
Helper function to the gen_cube.m file that inserts 90 degree rasterization pattern voxels into the cube.

## insert_defect.m 
Helper function in slicer_ctrl.m and slicer_gui.mlapp files that insert defects into a gcode file and creates a new file in the process.

## slicer_ctrl.m
Master function that accepts a configuration JSON file and calls gen_cube.m file and insert_defect.m file if needed. 
One of two ways (better way) to generate a gcode file of the cube.

## slicer_gui.mlapp
MatLab GUI where you can manually input cube parameters and generate a gcode file of the cube. One downside of this method is
that it can only insert one defect in the cube, not multiple.
